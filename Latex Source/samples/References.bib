abstract = {This paper describes one work-in-progress finding of a larger pilot study, investigating simulator sickness in virtual reality. The investigation asked participants (n = 10) to play though a VR application, and then complete a Simulator Sickness Qestionnaire. Participants were also asked for some demographic data, including rating their level of traditional gaming experience (0 to 5). A weak Spearman correlation between gaming experience and virtual reality sickness was found (rs = 0.56) in this sample group. Two hypotheses on why this correlation may exist are also presented in this paper - one described using the postural instability theory, and the other described with the rest frame hypothesis.},

ABSTRACT={A rapidly growing number of educators and students now embrace XR as a powerful technology with affordances that can support many benefits, including highly immersive learning experiences, empathy and perspectives on social issues; XR can be designed in ways that can provide new pathways to success and opportunity. Yet the mirror image is also true -- XR can be designed in ways that lead to increased risk, perpetuation of inequities and other harmful impacts to individuals and society. We need ways to analyze XR in terms of ethical aspects, educational efficacy and whether it supports or hinders human flourishing (i.e., eudaimonia). In this paper, we discuss XR as a double-edged sword that can be leveraged for positive or negative outcomes, whether intentionally or unintentionally; that is, we highlight various opportunities and benefits at hand, but also risks and possible negative impacts. We introduce E3XR, a framework that serves as an analytical lens to determine the ethics, learning theory and human flourishing aspects of an XR design. For each component of this framework, we review relevant literature and consider the threats and opportunities that can be evaluated. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the significance of this work and implications for designers and educators.}

abstract = {Motion sickness is one of important issues in immersive virtual environments. In some cases it may last for hours after participation in the virtual experience. Reducing the amount of motion sickness in healthcare applications is of great importance. This paper is examining how motion sickness can be reduced in immersive virtual environments. Two visual methods were designed to assess how they could help to alleviate motion sickness. The first method is the presence of a frame of reference (in form of a cockpit and a radial) and the second method is the visible path (in form of waypoints in the virtual environment). Four testing groups were formed: two for each individual method, one combining both methods and one control group. Each group consisted of 15 healthy subjects. Results show that there is a pattern in the data favouring visual path as a better method against motion sickness compared to the frame of reference.},

TITLE={Mismatch of Visual-Vestibular Information in Virtual Reality: Is Motion Sickness Part of the Brains Attempt to Reduce the Prediction Error?},

ISSN={1662-5161},   
ABSTRACT={Visually induced motion sickness (VIMS) is a relevant limiting factor in the use of virtual reality (VR) devices. Understanding the origin of this problem might help to develop strategies to circumvent this limitation. Previous studies have attributed VIMS to a mismatch between visual, and vestibular information, causing ambiguity of the position of the body in relation to its surrounding. Studies using EEG have shown a shift of the power spectrum to lower frequencies while VIMS is experienced. However, little is known about the relationship between the intensity of the VIMS and the changes in these power spectra. Moreover, the effect of different varieties of VIMS on the causal relationship between brain areas is largely unknown. Here, we used EEG to study 14 healthy subjects in a VR environment who were exposed to increasing levels of mismatch between vestibular and visual information. The frequency power and the bivariate transfer entropy as a measure for the information transfer were calculated. We found a direct association between increasing mismatch levels and subjective VIMS. With increasing VIMS, the proportion of slow EEG waves (especially 1–10 Hz) increases, especially in temporo-occipital regions. Furthermore, we found a general decrease in the information flow in most brain areas but especially in brain areas involved in the processing of vestibular signals and the detection of self-motion. We hypothesize that the general shift of frequency power and the decrease in information flow while experiencing high intensity VIMS represent a brain state of a reduced ability to receive, transmit and process information. We further hypothesize that the mechanism of reduced information flow is a general reaction of the brain to an unresolvable mismatch of information. This reaction aims on transforming a currently unstable model with a high prediction error into a stable model in an environment of minimal contradictory information.}
